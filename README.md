# make24_scraper

Web scraping suite for obtaining all valid hands (and possible solutions) for the [arithmetical card game, 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game), and collecting them into a [CSV file](hands.csv) for usage in a 24 game implementation.

Thank you to [GottfriedVille](http://www.gottfriedville.net/) for curating the solutions.
